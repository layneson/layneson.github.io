                    <li>6 apples (optionally peeled), sliced into 12ths (semi-sweet, like Cortland)</li>
                    <li>2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
                    <li>juice of half a lemon</li>

               <ul>
                   <li>1 stick unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
                   <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                   <li>1 and 1/3 cups self-rising flour</li>
                   <li>1/3 cup rolled oats</li>
                   <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
               </ul>
           </li>
           <li>Crust
            <ul>
                <li>1/4 cup sugar (for sprinkling on top)</li>
                <li>Spray bottle with water</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350&deg;.
            </li>
            <li>
                Peel (if desired) and slice apples. Place in a bowl and add the sugar, cinnamon, and lemon juice.
                Stir it up until all slices are well-coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a 2-quart glass baking dish with the apples, pressing them in as evenly as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Put topping sugar into bowl and press in butter until creamy and integrated.
                Next, add the rest of the topping ingredients and stir until combined.
                If the mixture is very thick, add splashes of milk until it is spreadable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread the topping over the apples as evenly as possible.
            </li>
            <li>
                Sprinkle crust sugar over the surface. Then spray with water until the entire top
                has a glossy shine and the bright white of the sugar is subdued.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for at least 45 minutes. Remove when the surface is nicely browned.
            </li>
        </ol>
